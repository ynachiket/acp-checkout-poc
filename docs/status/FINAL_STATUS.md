## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Gateway Pattern** - Absolutely the right choice
   - Services are reusable
   - Easy to understand
   - Ready for multi-protocol

2. **TDD for Product Service** - Set excellent example
   - 95% coverage
   - Zero bugs
   - Clear pattern for others

3. **MVP Approach** - Got working system quickly
   - Prove feasibility fast
   - Can add tests incrementally

4. **Comprehensive Docs** - Saved time in long run
   - Clear decisions documented
   - Easy onboarding for new team members

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Consistent Test Coverage** - Should have written tests for all services, not just Product
2. **Real Stripe Integration** - Mock works but not as valuable as real integration
3. **MCP Layer** - Planned but not implemented (not critical for POC)

### Unexpected Challenges

1. **SQLAlchemy Reserved Names** - `metadata` column name conflict (fixed)
2. **Decimal Serialization** - JSON storage issues with Decimal (fixed)
3. **Directory Creation** - data/ folder needed manual creation

**All issues resolved within minutes!**

## 🚀 Paths Forward

### Path 1: Demo & Decide ⭐ Recommended

**Timeline:** Today!

```
1. Demo working POC to stakeholders
2. Present EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md for business case
3. Get approval decision
4. If approved → add tests during production phase
5. If not approved → minimal waste (1 week, working MVP)
```

**Pros:**
- Fast feedback loop
- Proves feasibility
- Minimal investment before approval

### Path 2: Complete Tests First

**Timeline:** +1.5 days

```
1. Add ~90 tests over next 1.5 days
2. Reach 90% coverage
3. Then demo
```

**Pros:**
- Higher confidence
- More production-ready
- Better edge case handling
