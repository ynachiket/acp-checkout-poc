## 🎤 Presentation Tips

### Opening Line
> "What you're about to see is the future of commerce. Instead of apps and
> websites, customers will shop through conversation with AI. Nike can be
> one of the first major brands to offer this experience."

### During Demo
- Let the UI do the talking (it's beautiful!)
- Pause after each step to let it sink in
- Point out key features (price breakdown, shipping options)
- Show enthusiasm!

### For Questions

**"How does this work?"**
→ Show debug panel, explain API calls

**"Is this real?"**
→ Show database with created order

**"Can this scale?"**
→ Reference ARCHITECTURE.md and gateway pattern

**"What's the ROI?"**
→ Reference EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md ($60K/year savings)

**"How long to production?"**
→ "6-8 weeks with Nike integrations"
