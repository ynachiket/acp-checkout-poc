## 📈 Statistical Analysis

### ACP REST
- **Mean:** 58.32ms
- **Median:** 53.32ms
- **Std Dev:** 13.90ms
- **Range:** 50.93ms - 96.83ms

### MCP Protocol
- **Mean:** 50.49ms
- **Median:** 50.55ms
- **Std Dev:** 3.37ms ⭐ (More consistent!)
- **Range:** 44.95ms - 57.94ms

## 🎯 Key Findings

### 1. MCP is Faster Overall ✅
- **13.4% faster** than direct REST calls
- **8ms improvement** in average total time
- More consistent performance (lower std dev)

### 2. Why MCP Wins

**Fewer HTTP Calls:**
- ACP: 4 separate HTTP requests
- MCP: 3 tool invocations (complete_purchase combines 2 operations)

**Efficient Protocol:**
- JSON-RPC 2.0 is lightweight
- Single endpoint vs multiple endpoints
- Better connection reuse

**Request Batching:**
- MCP can batch related operations
- Reduces network overhead

### 3. Where MCP Adds Time

**Payment Tokenization:** +3.82ms
- This is because MCP's `complete_purchase` tool includes both tokenization AND checkout
- The overhead is offset by faster checkout completion

**Overall:** The slight tokenization overhead is more than compensated by other optimizations

## 💡 Implications

### For Production

✅ **Use MCP as primary interface**
- Faster performance
- Better developer experience
- Future-proof for multi-agent

✅ **Keep ACP for compatibility**
- Some agents may only support REST
- Good fallback option

### Performance Targets

**Current Performance:**
- MCP: ~50ms average (p50: 50.55ms)
- Well under 200ms target ✅
- Sub-second for complete flow ✅

**Optimization Potential:**
- Already very fast
- Focus on functionality over micro-optimization
- Performance is production-ready ✅

## 🎉 Conclusion

**MCP Protocol provides:**
1. ✅ Better performance (-13.4%)
2. ✅ Dynamic tool discovery
3. ✅ Multi-agent support
4. ✅ Future-proof architecture
5. ✅ More consistent latency

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Use MCP as the primary AI agent interface**

**The data proves MCP is the right choice!** 📊
